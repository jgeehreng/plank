# PLANK Host Version Discovery

The client discovers the installed PLANK Host release during its
normal bookmark availability poll. The host adds this element to both HTTP and
authenticated HTTPS `/serverinfo` responses:

```xml
<PlankHostMetadataVersion>1</PlankHostMetadataVersion>
<PlankHostVersion>0.1.0-0.104</PlankHostVersion>
```

Metadata schema version 1 defines the host-version element. Its value is the
exact package release embedded in the host binary at build time. This metadata
is informational and does not replace the GameStream-compatible `appversion`,
protocol feature flags, or explicit topology version.

When a bookmark is online, the main client row displays the value immediately
to the right of `Online`. An absent or empty element is tolerated and leaves
the version portion blank. A client also ignores the release element when the
metadata schema version is absent. Offline rows do not display a stale cached
value.

Unauthenticated HTTPS `/serverinfo` also includes a nameless occupancy bit:

```xml
<PlankOccupied>0</PlankOccupied>
```

`1` means a user desktop currently owns seat0, or a live PLANK stream is
active. `0` or an omitted element means the Client must show `Online`, not
`In Session`. The field must not include a username, UID, or session id.
Occupancy is a courtesy indicator only; it does not replace PAM or
active-desktop ownership.
